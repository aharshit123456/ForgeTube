README : The video assembler takes all the images in the Images folder and all the audio files in the Audio folder and the text-to-script from json file and concatenates 
them into a video. The duration of the picture displayed is same as the duration of the audio for that image. The Images and
Audio files sorted alphabetically and then compiled in that order. It is recommended to store the Audio and Image files by 
numbering them.
'''
''' MAIN THINGS TODO
1. TODO: Main Video Assembly Engine (Done by Souryabrata)
2. TODO: Implement Subtitles, via video embedding and .srt file generation. (Done by Souryabrata)
3. TODO: Read json and extract important parameters from it. (Done by Rahul)
4. TODO: Add support for video clips as well. (Assigned to Shopno)
5. TODO: Add the ability to compile multiple images (stored in a folder) for the one audio stream into a single clip. (Assigned to Shopno )
6. TODO: Add transition from clip to clip. (Done by Shopno)
7. TODO Add an intro and outro clip. Intro Clip contains : Video title / Short description (Done by Shopno).
Outro Clip contains a text "Made by ForgeTube team", MLSA Logo, Github Link to ForgeTube Main Page.
'''
'''
Additional TODOs
TODO: 1. Add a small delay to ensure smoother transition from clip to clip. (Assigned to Shopno)
TODO: 2. Experiment with adding Title screen, text and transitions, and other effects. (Assigned to Nancy)
TODO  3. Test the script against a large number of images with higher resolutions and audio files, document the performance.
TODO: 4. Test the script with various different audio and video extensions and codecs, find the best combination. 
TODO: 5. Allow the script to automatically assign the proper codec with the respective file extension.
TODO: 6. Run proper tests to document when video compiler corruption happens.
